## Description  
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the proposed target localization method using **Coupled Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (C-CPD)** based on **Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition (J-EVD)** for multistatic MIMO radar with coprime planar arrays.  

## Requirements  
- MATLAB (R2021a or later recommended)  
- Tensorlab toolbox (for tensor decomposition operations)
